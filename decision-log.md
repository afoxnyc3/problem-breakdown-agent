# Decision Log

This document records all significant technical and architectural decisions made during the development of the Problem Breakdown Agent.

## Decision Format

Each decision should follow this format:
- **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Decision**: Brief title
- **Context**: Why this decision was needed
- **Options Considered**: What alternatives were evaluated
- **Decision Made**: What was chosen and why
- **Consequences**: Expected impact and trade-offs

## Decisions

### 2024-09-16: Adopt Test-Driven Development (TDD) Workflow

**Context**: Need to ensure code quality and maintainability from the start.

**Options Considered**:
1. Write tests after implementation
2. No formal testing strategy
3. Test-Driven Development (TDD)

**Decision Made**: TDD - Write tests first, then implementation.

**Consequences**:
- Higher initial development time
- Better code coverage
- More reliable and maintainable code
- Clear specifications before implementation

### 2024-09-16: Use OpenAI Function Calling for Structured Output

**Context**: Need guaranteed parseable JSON responses from the AI model.

**Options Considered**:
1. Simple prompt engineering with JSON examples
2. Output parsing with regex
3. OpenAI function calling

**Decision Made**: OpenAI function calling with defined schema.

**Consequences**:
- Guaranteed structured output
- No parsing errors
- Slightly more complex implementation
- Better reliability

### 2024-09-16: ES Modules Over CommonJS

**Context**: Need to choose module system for TypeScript project.

**Options Considered**:
1. CommonJS (require/module.exports)
2. ES Modules (import/export)

**Decision Made**: ES Modules with `"type": "module"` in package.json.

**Consequences**:
- Modern JavaScript syntax
- Better tree-shaking potential
- Must use .js extensions in imports
- Requires Node.js 18+

### 2024-09-16: Simplify Project Structure to Single File

**Context**: Initial implementation was overengineered with multiple directories and files for a simple API.

**Options Considered**:
1. Keep multi-file structure for "best practices"
2. Consolidate into single file implementation
3. Two files (one for API, one for tests)

**Decision Made**: Single file implementation (index.ts) with inline test file.

**Consequences**:
- Much simpler to understand and maintain
- All logic visible in one place
- Faster development iteration
- Less boilerplate
- Still testable

### 2024-09-16: Vercel Serverless Deployment

**Context**: Need a deployment platform for the API endpoint.

**Options Considered**:
1. AWS Lambda
2. Google Cloud Functions
3. Vercel
4. Self-hosted

**Decision Made**: Vercel serverless functions.

**Consequences**:
- Simple deployment process
- Automatic scaling
- Free tier available
- Vendor lock-in to Vercel's platform
