  ```bash
  # Replace the placeholder in .env with your actual key
  OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-key-here
  ```

## 2. Test Locally (2 minutes)
```bash
# Test the agent directly
npm start

# Or test via the development server
npm run dev

# In another terminal, test the API
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"problem": "I need to learn React and build a portfolio website"}'
```
